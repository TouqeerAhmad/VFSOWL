Boult](https://vast.uccs.edu/~tboult/) 

The paper is focused on Variable Few-Shot Class Class Incremental (VFSCIL) and Variable Few-Shot Open-World Learning (VFSOWL). Unlike earlier approaches on Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that assume fixed number of classes (N-ways) and fixed number of samples (K-shots), VFSCIL operates in a more natural/practical setting where each incremental session could have up-to-N-classes (ways) and each class could have up-to-K-samples (shots). VFSCIL is then extended into VFSOWL.

The approach extended for VFSCIL/VFSOWL stems from our concurrent work on FSCIL named [FeSSSS](https://github.com/TouqeerAhmad/FeSSSS).
